# Zipf’s law visualization

This project aims to demonstrate the Zipf's law through visualization & match with the theoretical distribution.

Zipf's law (/zɪf/) is an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics that refers to the fact that many types of data studied in the physical and social sciences can be approximated with a Zipfian distribution, one of a family of related discrete power law probability distributions. Zipf distribution is related to the zeta distribution, but is not identical.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) generate node modules. If node js is already not installed please visit the provided link.
